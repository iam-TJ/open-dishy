These owners may\\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\\nefforts of others.\\n\\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\\nWork (the \\"Affirmer\\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\\n\\n1.

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer\'s Copyright\\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \\"Waiver\\").
